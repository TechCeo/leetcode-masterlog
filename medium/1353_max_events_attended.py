# Time Complexity: O(N log N)
#   - Sorting: O(N log N)
#   - Heap operations: O(N log N) in total
#Space Complexity: O(N) for heap

# Reflection:
# This is a classic greedy scheduling problem thatâ€™s disguised in the form of days and ranges.
# The idea of attending events by earliest end date is powerful when combined with a priority queue.
# Initially tried brute-force but this heap-greedy combination is clean and optimal.
